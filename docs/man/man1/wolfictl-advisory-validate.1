.SH NAME
.PP
wolfictl\-advisory\-validate \- Validate the state of advisory data


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBwolfictl advisory validate\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Validate the state of the advisory data.

.PP
This command examines all advisory documents to check the validity of the data.

.PP
It looks for issues like:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Missing required fields
.IP \(bu 2
Extra fields
.IP \(bu 2
Enum fields with an unrecognized value
.IP \(bu 2
Basic business logic checks

.RE

.PP
It also looks for issues in the \fIchanges\fP introduced by the current state of the
advisories repo, relative to a "base state" (such as the last known state of
the upstream repo's main branch). For example, it will detect if an advisory
was removed, which is not allowed.

.PP
Using distro auto\-detection is the easiest way to run this command. It will
automatically detect the distro you're running, and use the correct advisory
repo URL and base hash to compare against.

.PP
If you want to run this command without distro auto\-detection, you'll need to
specify the following flags:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\-\-no\-distro\-detection
.IP \(bu 2
\-\-advisories\-repo\-dir
.IP \(bu 2
\-\-advisories\-repo\-url
.IP \(bu 2
\-\-advisories\-repo\-base\-hash
.IP \(bu 2
\-\-distro\-repo\-dir
.IP \(bu 2
\-\-package\-repo\-url

.RE

.PP
More information about these flags is shown in the documentation for each flag.

.PP
If any issues are found in the advisory data, the command will exit 1, and will
print an error message that specifies where and how the data is invalid.
